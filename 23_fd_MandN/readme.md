### DISCO:
1. In a grid, the full width of a cell is 12 columns.
2. For the grids, small is for small screen, medium is for medium screens, and large is for large screens. Setting different cell sizes for different screen sizes would display the cell at the set size for that specific screen size. For example, in ```<div class="medium-6 large-4 cell">12/6/4 cells</div>``` at a medium sized screen, the cell would be 6 columns wide, and at a large screen size, that same cell would be 4 columns wide.
3. We could use grids, columns, and cells to help us build forms.
4. Different input types give us different forms.
5. We could use a "help text" through ```aria-describedby```
6. Fieldset gives us a border (refer to the checkbox in index.html).

### QCC:
1. How can we use the css from foundation?
