K19: Sessions Greetings
2022-11-03
time spent: 2.5 hrs

DISCO:
0) To use redirect (takes you to a different page) we imported redirect from flask and did return redirect (“/”)
1) To display error messages in login page, we can put {{msg}} in html file and using it in app.py render_template
2) When signed in, a cookie (randomly generated string) is created and stored. When you try to enter again it checks
if there is a cookie and if there is, you get automatically signed in. Cookie gets deleted when you sign out.
3) A cookie contains information.
4) In order to modify the cookie you need to know the secret key. Use: app.secret.key = <secret key>
5) Session stores and manages cookies. Amount of data in session == how many cookies are used
     To store data in session: session[KEY] = <value>
     To remove data from session: session.pop(KEY)

QCC:
0) How do we use try and except for testing if the inputted username and password match what is hardcoded?
1) How do we use secret key?
