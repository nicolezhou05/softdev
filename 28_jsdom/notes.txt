DISCO
- You can have a list of classes in the html file.
- By adding a string to the class, you are adding a class identifier for that element.
- Depending on the order of the classes in the styling, you will only be able to visually see some of the changes.

var <varName> = <function name>(<parameters>){
    <code>
    return ...
};

const <varName> = (<params>) => {
    <code>
    return ...
};

QCC:
- Are there any benefits or detriments to using either form of writing anonymous functions?
- Perhaps the benefits of using anonymous functions is so that you can store their functionality and use them elsewhere.
